This repository contains a file, Profiles.xlsx, which contains information about the profiles described in the paper "An Uncertainty-aware Optimization Approach For Flexible Loads Of Smart Grid Prosumers: a Use Case on the Cardiff Energy Grid".

The information is organized as follows. 
- The first row describes the name of each user profile.
- The second row describes which interval is being considered: some user profile may have flexibility settings divided in more time intervals.
- The third row has only "ST" (Start time) and "FT" (Finish time) as values: before each of these, the start time (or finish time) of the flexibility interval for the corresponding device is reported.
- The fourth row contains the flexibility intervals for washing machines.
- The fifth row contains the flexibility intervals for tumble dryers.
- The sixth row contains the flexibility intervals for dishwashers.
- The seventh row contains the flexibility intervals for electric ovens.
- The eighth row contains the flexibility intervals for electric vehicles.
